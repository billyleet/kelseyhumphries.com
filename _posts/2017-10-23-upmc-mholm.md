## Opportunity
The portal for UPMC Health Plan members, MyHealthOnline (MHOL), contains tools and information designed to help people manage their health insurance. However, it was designed and developed in pieces, and most had never been revisited since their initial conception. This resulted in a disjointed and confusing user experience. In addition, the age of the technologies it was built on limited opportunities for improvement. Our IT department began an initiative to fully modernize the underlying technologies of the portal, and Consumer Innovation recognized an opportunity to refresh and standardize the visual design, as well as better organize information and content.
## Mapping Current State
Our first step was understanding the current ecosystem of pages: objectives, functions, and connections. One tool we used for this was writing job stories for each page. 
We also spent time mapping out the current state of each section of the portal and uncovering connections and dependencies that might influence our designs.
